    <string name="firstStartupDialog">This little app has one purpose:\n
        \nGive your style of praying a new momentum! \n
        \nHow?! It does not give you any advice or anything else. It simply vibrates.
        \nIt passively vibrates every X minutes, whereas the repeat time is defined by you. The gist of the reminding -
        vibrating - is to motivate you to do a quick prayer, briefly speak with god and remind you of his presence in
        your life.
        \nBelieve me! Jesus will change everything!
        \n
        \nTo provide some comfort, the app has various adjustable preferences.
        \n- repeat time of vibration
        \n- duration of vibration
        \n- off-hours - sleep mode at night
        \n- own kind of vibration pattern
        \n- take a break button
        \n- shut down function
        \n- mind calls and silent/vibration mode
        \n- use acoustic notifications
        \nOnce the app is started it does not need any adjustments anymore and keeps running until you tell it
        otherwise.
        It boots with your device, adjusts to your off-hours and offers a break-button if the reminding is not
        appropriate at the time.
